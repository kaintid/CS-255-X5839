Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a driving test training company.  They want a software that is hosted on a server that has a website where student can enroll in classes and take online exams and practices.

What did you do particularly well?
Designing a system design document for the software.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the Business requirements and to include more detailed functions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  
I carefully read and understand what the client wants and to anticipate the users.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would start by identifying all the needs and wants of the client.  Then I would look at the target market and what the software is intended to function.
